# Repository

- This repository is for a in-line terminal application to generate a Team-Profile HTML file after answering various questions about each team member and entering the appropriate information.

# Technology-Used

- For this project I used Node.js to build an application to gather information using npm inquirer to prompt the user for questions, then using Object Oriented Program (OOP) build the team of Employees and generate an HTML file to display the all of their Profiles.

- Also I had to use npm jest to write tests for the main constructor function (Employee) and the relevant subclasses (Manager, Engineer, and Intern). After running these test they should all pass telling us our application is in working order.

# User-Story

- To start the application the user must first open the integrated terminal and enter "index.js."

- This begins the set of questions beginning by asking for the Manager Information.

- The user is then presented with a menu asking if they'd like to add additional team members (Engineer, Intern) or finish building a team.

- After building each desired team member and finishing all questions, the application generates an HTML file with all the team profiles and their information onto a webpage.

# Conclusion

03/05/21
- Overall this homework assignment has been extremely difficult to get completed on time. So far I still can't get my objects with the relevant information to properly work. I'm going to continue working on this project tomorrow in hopes to get my HTML page to generate and then write my tests for each of the classes.
